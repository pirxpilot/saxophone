### New features

### Breaking changes

* To improve performance, attributes are no longer automatically parsed for every tag. Users should call `Saxophone#parseAttrs` whenever they actually want the attributes parsed.
* To improve performance, entities are no longer automatically decoded for every text chunk. Users should call `Saxophone#parseEntities` whenever they actually want to decode entities from a text.
